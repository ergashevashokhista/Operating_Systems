All files in Linux are arranged around a big tree rooted at '/'.First we need to mount the parent directory shoudl be mounted then others can be mounted manually or with mount command.
Mount(attached) - gives us a information about what filesystems are currently in use. 
<command - $ mount>
umount - is used for detacheing the devices from the Tree.

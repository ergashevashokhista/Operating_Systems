All files in Linux are arranged around a big tree rooted at '/'.First we need to mount the parent directory shoudl be mounted then others can be mounted manually or with mount command.
Mount(attached) - gives us a information about what filesystems are currently in use. 
<command - $ mount>
umount - is used for detacheing the devices from the Tree.

-everything in virtual filesystem is like a file
- when the program tries to perform some operation, the filesystem driver answers the request like with file.

In order to perform the operation of recording and playing recorded files 
u need to be in root
<sudo -s>
<[sudo] password:>
If u are in root then u will have # instead of $

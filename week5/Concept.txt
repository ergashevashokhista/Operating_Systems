Race condition - is a condition when multiple threads are accessing 
shared memory in undetermined order, and when at least one access 
is for “write” i.e. modifying the memory content”.

Mutex - is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource
Ex2
1. need to check wether the file is empty or not, and create the numbers file
2. need to lock the process for eliminating the interruptions - in order to prevent race 
3. turn on the loop for numbers
4. read and find the last number in the file and add one and append it to the end
See how much time will it take to occur race condition. And explain what was the critical region.
5. unlock it - remove the lock file
6. open another sh file in order to run it simultaneously(one in the foregraound 
and one in the background) - run it on ubuntu
